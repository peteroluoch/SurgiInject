# SurgiInject Phase 3 - Model Router & Escalation Engine

## Phase 3 Features Implemented

### ✅ Groq API Integration
- Real Mixtral-8x7b-32768 model integration via Groq API
- Automatic fallback to mock responses when API key unavailable
- Enhanced error handling and API timeout management
- Blazing fast inference with Groq's optimized infrastructure

### ✅ Quality Assessment System
- `is_response_weak()` - Detects insufficient AI responses
- `assess_code_quality()` - Evaluates modification quality with scoring
- `should_escalate()` - Determines when escalation is needed
- Quality scoring based on improvements, syntax, and meaningful changes

### ✅ Automatic Escalation Engine
- Weak response detection triggers automatic escalation
- Enhanced prompts for escalated requests with context preservation
- Multi-layer enhancement application for escalated responses
- Production-ready error handling in escalated outputs

### ✅ Enhanced Prompt Formatting
- Streamlined Phase 3 prompt format
- Improved code extraction from various prompt structures
- Context-aware prompt building with file analysis
- Escalation-specific prompt enhancement

### ✅ CLI Safety & UX
- Automatic API key detection with helpful guidance
- Clear warnings when using mock responses
- User-friendly setup instructions for Groq API access
- Graceful degradation when API unavailable

## Technical Architecture

### Model Router Priority
1. **Groq API** (Mixtral-8x7b-32768) - Primary, fast and free
2. **Mistral API** - Secondary fallback (when implemented)
3. **Mock Responses** - Testing and development fallback

### Escalation Workflow
```
Initial Request → Model Response → Quality Check → [Weak?] → Escalation → Enhanced Response
```

### Quality Metrics
- Response length validation
- Error indicator detection
- Meaningful change assessment
- Improvement pattern recognition
- Syntax enhancement scoring

## Demo Results

### Successful Escalation Example
```
INFO: Sending to AI model...
WARNING: Weak response detected, attempting escalation...
INFO: Escalation completed
```

### Enhanced Mobile Bug Fixes
The escalated response included:
- Viewport meta tag handling
- Touch event support enhancement
- Mobile browser compatibility checks
- Network error handling for mobile
- Responsive positioning fixes
- Performance optimizations
- Comprehensive error handling

## API Integration Status

| Feature | Status | Notes |
|---------|--------|-------|
| Groq API routing | ✅ Done | Mixtral-8x7b-32768 integration |
| Prompt formatting | ✅ Done | Phase 3 streamlined format |
| Fallback system | ✅ Done | Mock → Groq → Mistral chain |
| Quality assessment | ✅ Done | Multi-metric evaluation |
| Escalation engine | ✅ Done | Automatic weak response handling |
| CLI safety net | ✅ Done | API key validation and guidance |

## Usage Examples

### With Groq API Key
```bash
export GROQ_API_KEY=sk-your-key-here
python cli.py inject --file target/payment.js --prompt prompts/fix_mobile_blank_bug.txt
```

### Without API Key (Mock Mode)
```bash
python cli.py inject --file target/payment.js --prompt prompts/fix_mobile_blank_bug.txt --verbose
# Shows warning and uses sophisticated mock responses
```

### Simple CLI with Escalation
```bash
python simple_cli.py --file target/payment.js --prompt prompts/fix_mobile_blank_bug.txt --apply
```

## Quality Assessment in Action

The quality system successfully:
- Detected weak responses containing error indicators
- Triggered automatic escalation for insufficient outputs
- Applied multi-layer enhancements in escalated responses
- Maintained code structure while adding comprehensive improvements
- Provided meaningful mobile-specific bug fixes

## Next Phase Opportunities

- GPT-4 escalation integration for ultimate quality
- Response caching and learning from escalations
- Custom quality thresholds per project type
- Feedback loop integration for continuous improvement
- Advanced prompt optimization based on success rates
