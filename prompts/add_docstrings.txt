Add comprehensive docstrings to all functions and classes in this Python file. Follow these guidelines:

1. **Function Docstrings:**
   - Use Google-style docstrings
   - Include Args, Returns, and Raises sections where applicable
   - Describe what the function does clearly and concisely
   - Include type hints in the docstring if not already present

2. **Class Docstrings:**
   - Describe the class purpose and responsibilities
   - Include Attributes section if the class has significant attributes
   - Mention inheritance if applicable

3. **Module Docstring:**
   - Add a module-level docstring at the top if missing
   - Describe the module's purpose and main functionality

4. **Examples:**
   ```python
   def calculate_total(items, tax_rate=0.1):
       """Calculate the total cost including tax.
       
       Args:
           items (list): List of item prices
           tax_rate (float, optional): Tax rate as decimal. Defaults to 0.1.
           
       Returns:
           float: Total cost including tax
           
       Raises:
           ValueError: If items list is empty or tax_rate is negative
       """
   ```

5. **Preserve existing code structure and formatting**
6. **Only add docstrings where they are missing**
7. **Keep existing docstrings if they are already comprehensive**

Apply this to all functions and classes in the file while maintaining the existing code structure and functionality.
