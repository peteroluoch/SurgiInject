Analyze the provided source code for mobile-specific display issues that could cause blank screens or rendering problems on mobile devices.

Focus on the following potential issues:
1. CSS viewport settings and responsive design problems
2. JavaScript errors that might occur on mobile browsers
3. Touch event handling issues
4. Mobile-specific API usage problems
5. Screen size and orientation handling
6. Memory or performance issues that affect mobile devices

For each issue found:
1. Identify the specific problem and its location in the code
2. Explain why it causes blank screens or display issues on mobile
3. Provide a corrected version of the problematic code
4. Add appropriate error handling and fallbacks for mobile devices

If the code appears to be working correctly for mobile, add defensive programming measures to prevent common mobile display issues:
- Add proper viewport meta tags for HTML files
- Include responsive design breakpoints for CSS
- Add touch event support for interactive elements
- Include mobile-specific error handling
- Add performance optimizations for mobile devices

Ensure the fixed code maintains all existing functionality while being mobile-friendly and robust against common mobile browser issues.
