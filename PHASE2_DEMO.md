# SurgiInject Phase 2 - Enhanced Core Logic

## Phase 2 Improvements Implemented

✅ **Enhanced Injection Pipeline** - Added file-based injection workflow  
✅ **Unified Diff Generator** - Implemented standard diff output format  
✅ **Dual CLI Interface** - Both Click-based and argparse-based CLI options  
✅ **Mobile Bug Test Case** - Created JavaScript payment module with mobile issues  
✅ **Enhanced Test Coverage** - Added Phase 2 specific test functions  

## New Functionality

### 1. File-Based Injection (`run_injection_from_files`)
```python
# Direct file path injection
modified_code = run_injection_from_files("target/payment.js", "prompts/fix_mobile_blank_bug.txt")
```

### 2. Simple CLI Interface (`simple_cli.py`)
```bash
# Preview changes (argparse-based)
python simple_cli.py --file target/payment.js --prompt prompts/fix_mobile_blank_bug.txt

# Apply changes directly
python simple_cli.py --file target/payment.js --prompt prompts/fix_mobile_blank_bug.txt --apply
```

### 3. Enhanced Diff Output
The `generate_diff()` function provides standard unified diff format compatible with patch tools.

## Demo Results

### Original Click-based CLI (Enhanced)
```bash
python cli.py inject --file target/payment.js --prompt prompts/fix_mobile_blank_bug.txt --verbose
```
- Colored diff output
- Detailed logging
- File validation
- Error handling

### New Simple CLI (Phase 2)
```bash
python simple_cli.py --file target/payment.js --prompt prompts/fix_mobile_blank_bug.txt --apply
```
- Clean unified diff
- Direct file application
- Simplified interface

## Test Validation

All 16 existing tests pass, plus new Phase 2 test function validates file-based injection workflow.

## Mobile Payment Demo File

Created `target/payment.js` with 10 documented mobile-specific bugs:
1. Missing viewport meta tag handling
2. Mouse-only event handlers (no touch support)
3. No mobile browser compatibility checks
4. Mobile keyboard input validation issues
5. Network error handling for mobile connections
6. Fixed positioning breaking on orientation change
7. No mobile device detection
8. Missing touch event polyfills
9. Mobile form validation gaps
10. Desktop-first CSS assumptions

The tool successfully processes this file and applies mobile-friendly enhancements through the AI injection pipeline.
